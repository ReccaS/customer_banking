**Customer Banking System**


## Description
This Customer Banking System allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and cd accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Installation
Download the following files from my reposity:

   * Account.py
   * cd_account.py
   * savings_account.py
   * customer_banking.py

Installation Guide:

   * Create a new reposity called <code style='color:red'>customer_banking</code>
   * Clone the new reposity to your computer
   * Inside your local Git reposity, add the files from your file downloads.
   * Push these changes to Github or Gitlab.

## User Instruction

After you download all the files to your computer, open the file named customer_banking.py in VS Code. Run the file using Python. Once you click the run button, the code will prompt you with, "Enter your savings balance:". You will type any amount you want and hit Enter. Next, it will ask, "What is your savings interest rate?". You will input the interest rate and press Enter. Then, it will ask, "How many months?". You will type the number of months and hit Enter.

After providing answers to these three questions — your savings balance, interest rate, and number of months — the code will calculate and print your interest earned and new savings balance. The code will then perform the same process for your CD account.
